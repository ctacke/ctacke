Embedded-ish Software Architect

## I current work for:

[Hypergiant](www.hypergiant.com) as a Solutions Architect.  We do AI/ML work for space and defense.  Want to put a Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano into space?  Need help writing ground station software? We can help.
[Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) as a...no idea what my title is.  I do a lot of work that bridges NuttX to Mono, also do a lot of testing and working on Meadow for Linux.
[Solution Family](www.solution-family.com) as a Cofounder.  We do industrial and process automation stuff.  Way too much to explain here, but basically adding visibility to plant floor quality and OEE type stuff.

## I work on:

- Mostly .NET stuff.  Yes, I know C/C++, Visual Basic, Python, Rust, Java and probably others, but C# is my preference.
- Robotics and Embedded stuff.  From cobots and robots to 4-20mA sensors.  You need to integrate hardware with software?  I've probably already done it.
- Vehicle stuff.  Rovers and smart mobile platforms? ROS2? Yes please!

## Working on learning:

- AI and ML to a better depth.
